# ETHOS
ETHOS (Evaluative Text Heuristic for Objective Scrutiny) analyzes argument structure, validity, and rhetorical quality through advanced NLP. Combining rule-based analysis with neural models (BERT), it identifies claims, premises, fallacies, and rhetorical devices, then visualizes relationships and assesses logical soundness and clarity.
